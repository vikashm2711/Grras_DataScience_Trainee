----> log into database ( in case of error make sure your database is running at localhost on port number 3306)

#mysql -u root -p 

----> full command  mysql --host hostname --port 3306 --user username --database dbname -p 
#show databases
---> for showing the databases
#select user,host from mysql,user;
---> to check user and host name

---> for creating a database 

#CREATE DATABASE student CHARACTER SET utf8;

----> select created database student

#USE student; OR we can login through #mysql -u root -p student(database name)

----> create a table called student

#CREATE TABLE student(sid INT(5) NOT NULL auto_increment, name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, ph_no VARCHAR(13) DEFAULT 'NA',email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT `pk` PRIMARY KEY  (sid) );

----> create a table called address connected to student

----> show tables in student databases

#SHOW TABLES;

----> let's see schema of student table

#DESCRIBE student;

----> let's see schema of address table

#DESCRIBE address;

----> let's see schema of fees table 

#DESCRIBE fees;

#DESCRIBE course;

-----> now create a admin user for student database 

----> to delete users from database 

#DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='student';
----> DELETE FROM database.tablename WHERE user='username'

#CREATE USER 'student'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'student';

----> for remote user give usernameas --> 'student'@'domain.com' or 'student'@'192.168.5.10' or 'student'@'%'


----> now grant permission to newley created user on all tables of student database

#GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON student.* TO 'student'@'localhost';

----> if want to remove privileges just REVOKE instead of grant
----> create a user who can only fire select command to student database 

#CREATE USER 'st'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'student';

----> grant only select query on student database tables 

#GRANT SELECT ON student.* TO 'st'@'localhost'; 

----> use SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT,... to provide more privileges to an user or for specific table use student.table name as student.address or so 

----> to verify privileges just logout by command exit and login with user privileges

#EXIT;

#mysql -u student -p student

----> lets check select privileges 

#SELECT * FROM student;

----> it will work now create a table 

#CREATE TABLE new_table (id TEXT,data BLOB);

----> BLOB is data type of mariadb and you will see table will be created

----> Now let's delete the table 

#DROP TABLE new_table;


----> logout again 

#EXIT 


----> login with different user 

#mysql -u st -p student

----> show table command 

#SHOW TABLES;

----> fire select query on student table

#SELECT * FROM student;

----> now try to create table 

#CREATE TABLE new_table(id int(5));

----> you will get error message as st user does not have permission of maniplutation 

#EXIT


#mysql -u student -p student
